# Eddie's Content Managment System Version 2.0


###Site Purpose:
 I set up this site as a showcase of some of my more advanced website creation using the PHP language as well as jQuery, vanilla Javascript, Data Binding, General MVC framework use.
 
I also chose to display this knowlege using the PHP Framework named Laravel, this is now up to version 8.X which is the version i chose to write this new updated site with.  I previously had this same site up and running but using Laravel v5.X which is now quite out dated, this is why the V2.0 site is here.

#Areas of the Site:


  * Frontend/Backend Arcitechure
  * User Managment
  * User Role Managment
  * Site Administration Security (Admins only Areas)
  * Page Managment
  * Page hirarchey
  * Blog Post Managment

This list will expand as i improve the site during its development stage.
